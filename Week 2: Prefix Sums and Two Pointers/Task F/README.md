### Time constraints: 2 secs
### Memory constraints: 512 Mb

### Description:
You are given a sequence of n numbers a_i. Find the number ∑(1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n) a_i*a_j*a_k. Since the resulting number may be too large, you are required to compute it modulo 1000000007.

### Input:
The first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10ˆ6). The second line contains n integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10ˆ6).

### Output:
Output the required number modulo 1000000007.
