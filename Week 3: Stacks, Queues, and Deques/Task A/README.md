### Time constraints: 1 sec
### Memory constraints: 64 Mb

### Description:
The task is to determine whether a given sequence of parentheses (which can include round (), square [], and curly {} brackets) is valid. An empty sequence is considered valid. The rules for a valid sequence are as follows:
- If A is valid, then (A), [A], and {A} are also valid
- If A and B are both valid, then the concatenation AB is also valid

### Input:
The input consists of a single line containing a sequence of parentheses, with a maximum length of 100000 characters.

### Output:
If the sequence is valid, output "yes"; otherwise, output "no".
