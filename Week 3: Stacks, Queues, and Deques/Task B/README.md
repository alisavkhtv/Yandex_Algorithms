### Time constraints: 1 sec

### Description:
Lainland is a one-dimensional world represented as a line, where there are N cities sequentially numbered from 0 to N−1. The direction from the first city to the zero city is called west, and the opposite direction is called east.

When a crisis unexpectedly struck Lainland, all the inhabitants of the world began to experience deep confusion. Rumors spread throughout Lainland that life was better in the east than in the west.

Thus began the Great Lainland Migration. The inhabitants of the world left their native streets en masse and moved east until they arrived at a city where the average cost of living was lower than in their hometown.

### Input:
The first line contains a single integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10ˆ5) — the number of cities in Lainland. The second line contains N integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10ˆ9) — the average cost of living in cities from 0 to N−1.

### Output:
For each city, in order from 0 to N−1, output the number of the city to which its original inhabitants will migrate. If the inhabitants of a city do not stop in any other city and move towards the Eastern Infinite Nothing, output -1.
