### Description:
In postfix notation (or Reverse Polish Notation), the operation is written after its two operands. For example, the sum of two numbers A and B is written as A B +. The expression B C + D * represents the familiar (B + C) * D, while the expression A B C + D * + means A + (B + C) * D. The advantage of postfix notation is that it does not require parentheses or additional rules about operator precedence for its evaluation.

### Input:
The input consists of a single line containing an expression in postfix notation, which includes digits and the operations +, -, and *. The digits and operations are separated by spaces. There may be any number of spaces at the end of the line.

### Output:
You need to output the value of the recorded expression.
