# Size of a Subtree

### Time constraint: 2 secs
### Memory constraint: 1 Gb

### Description:
Given an undirected tree rooted at vertex 1, for each vertex, calculate how many vertices are contained in the subtree rooted at that vertex.

### Input:
The first line contains the number of vertices V (3 ≤ V ≤ 100000). In the next V−1 lines, two numbers are given: the numbers of the connected vertices.

### Output:
Output V numbers — the sizes of the subtrees for each vertex.
