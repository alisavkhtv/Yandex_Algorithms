# Geneology Tree: Least Common Ancestor

### Time constraints: 2 secs
### Memory constraints: 64 Mb

### Description:
In a genealogy tree, your task is to determine the least common ancestor (LCA) for given pairs of elements. The LCA of elements A and B is defined as the deepest element C such that C is an ancestor of both A and B. An element is considered its own ancestor.

### Input:
The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000) — the number of elements in the genealogy tree.The next N−1 lines contain pairs of names: descendant parent, specifying the parent-child relationships.

Following this, there are multiple lines containing pairs of names for which you need to find the LCA.

### Output:
For each query, output the name of the lowest common ancestor for the specified pair of elements.
