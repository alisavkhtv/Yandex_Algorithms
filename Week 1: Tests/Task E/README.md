# The Maximum Product of Two Numbers (design of tests)

### Description:
At the competition, participants were presented with the following task: You are given a list filled with arbitrary integers. Find two numbers in this list whose product is maximal. Output these numbers in non-decreasing order. The list contains at least two elements. The numbers are chosen such that the answer is unique.

### Output:
The solution should have a complexity of O (n), where n is the size of the list. You need to develop a set of test cases (input data only) for this task that thoroughly checks participants' solutions.
