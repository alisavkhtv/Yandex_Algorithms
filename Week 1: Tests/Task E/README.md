# The Maximum Product of Two Numbers (design of tests)

### Description:
At the competition, participants were presented with the following task: 

"You are given a list filled with arbitrary integers. Find two numbers in this list whose product is maximal. Output these numbers in non-decreasing order. The list contains at least two elements. The numbers are chosen such that the answer is unique. The solution should have a complexity of O (n), where n is the size of the list."

You need to develop a set of test cases (input data only) for this task that thoroughly checks participants' solutions.

### Output:
You should submit a text file, not a program.

In the first line of the file, write the number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 20) — the number of tests you have developed. In the following N lines, write one test case per line. Each test case should consist of one line containing a number K (2 ≤ K ≤ 10) — the number of integers in the sequence, followed by K integers a_i (−100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
