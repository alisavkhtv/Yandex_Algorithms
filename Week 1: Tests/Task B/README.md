### Description:
As is known, in autumn and winter, it gets light late, and in the morning, one just wants to sleep a little longer instead of going to school! Some students are even willing to get dressed without opening their eyes just to postpone the moment of waking up. So Sasha decided that he could feel around in his closet for a T-shirt and socks with his eyes closed and only then turn on the light and get dressed. In Sasha's closet, there are two drawers. One contains A blue T-shirts and B red T-shirts, while the other contains C blue pairs of socks and D red pairs of socks. Sasha wants both the T-shirt and the socks to be of the same color. He blindly pulls out M T-shirts and N pairs of socks. On that first morning, Sasha wondered what the minimum total number of clothing items (M + N) he should pull out so that among them there are guaranteed to be a T-shirt and socks of the same color. The specific color of the clothing items is completely unimportant to Sasha.

### Input:
The program receives four non-negative integers as input:
- A (the number of blue T-shirts)
- B (the number of red T-shirts)
- C (the number of blue socks)
- D (the number of red socks)
All numbers do not exceed 10**9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one matching set of a T-shirt and socks in the closet.

### Output:
The program should output two numbers: the number of T-shirts M and the number of pairs of socks N that Sasha should take. It is necessary that among M T-shirts and N pairs of socks, there is guaranteed to be a matching pair, while ensuring that the sum M + N is minimized.
